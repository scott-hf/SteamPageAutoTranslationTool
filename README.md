# SteamPageAutoTranslationTool

This project is intended to be for solo or a small team of indie developers to help with steam page store translations. According to some of the data and reports from the Chris Zukowski & the HTMAG community, having translated store pages/names can help increase visibility of your steam products. This tool takes one translation json file from steam and converts it automatically to all other store page languages. It uses Google Translator python library.


To use this app, if you have python, you can run **pip install -r requirements**  and then run the **run_gui.bat** file

Otherwise, you can download the zip file from the releases section and run the executable

**How-To:**
